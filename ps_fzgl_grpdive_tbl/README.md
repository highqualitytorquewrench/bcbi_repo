_Welcome to the guide for the Business Capabilities Business Intelligence Repository.  Here you'll fine a good number of useful resources, tip,s and best practices tailored to your work in the Azure Synapse environment.  Explore, collaborate with others, and grow!_

READMEs (including this one) should be of a format that allows easy and intuitive navigation of a repository, and ideally they should be updated when new files are created, or periodically when there are changes to the organization of a repository.  

*Things to Remember in the Repository*
<ol>
 <li>Naming Conventions: The Key to Clarity<ul>
  <li>Proper Date Format (ASCII) - Consistency is king!  YYYY-MM-DD is good, especially for sorting files...</li>
  <li>Descriptive Query Titles - Let others know your purpose/motivation.</li>
  <li>Author Details & Team Information - Give credit where it's due (do this stuff <i>inside</i> the file though!)</li>
  </ul></li>
 <li>Git Good Practices: The Path to Success<ul>
  <li>Saving Queries - Your hard work matters.  Don't lose it!  Make sure that you save your queries and commit (upload/update) them to the respository.  It makes things way easier to direct coworkers to what you were doing, and it has the added benefit of backing up your hard work.</li>
  <li>When to Commit - Frequent updates keep us in sync, especially necessary if you're working with someone else on the same project or file.</li>
  <li>Commit Regularly - Major logic changes or every 1-3 hours, generally whichever is more frequent.</li>
  </ul></li>
   <li>Fun and more with GIT: Because We're a Team<ul>
  <li>Write good commit messages!  If you want to include the funniest ones monthly at your group meeting, that can be a fun way to encourage people to have fun while coding.  </li>
  <li>Make sure to poke around and see what others are doing, learning is more than half of programming!</li>
  </ul></li>
  <li>Storage Best Practice: Tidy Code, Tidy Mind<ul>
  <li>Certain portions of the code base that are not actively being used/do not provide new logic will be deprecated (by archiving into subfolders marked with some form of 'deprecated').</li>
  <li>If you have a better idea than a deprecated subfolder, don't consider this methodology set in stone.  Improvements can always be made to the process of archiving old queries, as long as the main repository always includes relevant queries that are currently being created or are in current use.</li>
  </ul></li>
</ol>
